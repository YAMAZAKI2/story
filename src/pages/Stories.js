â€œAkira, a 25 year old solo traveler, who loved to escape from his normal life on weekends to experience new adventures. He loved being in nature, as it always made him feel at home. Despite not having a circle of friends, Akira formed a unique bond with nature that made him feel fulfilled, and he never felt the need to make any new friends, since his childhood. 

Akira grew up in a village with his grandparents, who were the only family he had. They would often take him to the jungle and mountains, sometimes to explore and sometimes to collect woods for fire. Even after his grandparent's death, Akira continued to cherish their memories and their shared love for nature.
